# HungerCam

http://heroku.hungercam.com

HungerCam is a simple web application that utilizes the Instagram API. Photos are
filtered for food using the tag "foodporn" for current lack of a better search
filter.

The front-end was created using AngularJS and Browserify. The back-end was created
using Node.js and Express.

## To-Do List

Originally, HungerCam was supposed to be an application that helped separate the
hipster foodies from the hipster photographers on Instagram. It was also supposed
to help people decide what to eat based on where they were and what they saw around
them. Thus, this is just a fun project that will fill the empty void in my heart
until I can figure out a better way to do this.

-Be able to take a picture and upload it.
-Be able to use filters.
-Add geolocation so that the food photo can help lead to the food location.
-Add an upvote system so that the most popular food photos are shown first.
-Much more to make this a more long-term and interactive/social project/reality!
